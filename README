Installation:
DriveCoin uses PyCrypto and Twisted:
pip install pycrypto
pip install twisted


DriveCoin requires a beacon of randomness to operate, in reality this may be derived from financial markets. We have simulated this with a locally running web server.

Before running DriveCoin you must run the beacon service in the background:
python beacon.py


To run the wallet app (create wallets, send money) run:
python wallet.py

To run a miner to add pending transactions to the blockchain:
python miner.py

Note: The wallet and miner cannot be run at the same time on the same computer as they both serve on TCP port 8124.
